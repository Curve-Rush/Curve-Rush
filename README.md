    - **Jump Control**: Time your jumps precisely to maximize height and distance.
    - **Landing Technique**: Align your trajectory for seamless transitions between slopes.
    - **Momentum Management**: Maintain velocity through varied terrain for higher scores.
2. **Control Mastery**:
    - Timing is crucial for initiating jumps and maintaining flow.
    - Plan your trajectory in advance to anticipate landing spots.
    - Recover quickly from imperfect landings by adjusting angles or using small bumps to regain speed.
